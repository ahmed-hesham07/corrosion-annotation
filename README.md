# Corrosion Segmentation and Annotation Project

This project is an end-to-end solution designed to automatically detect, segment, and annotate corrosion areas in images. It combines advanced deep learning with traditional image processing to produce high-quality segmentation masks and overlays. The system not only generates outputs for creating a robust dataset but also classifies the corrosion severity based on the segmented area.

## Overview

This project automates the process of image annotation by segmenting corrosion parts in images and classifying their severity (e.g., HIGH, Severe, Medium, Low, or None). The outputs of the system are:

- **Raw Images:** Original input images saved as a reference.
- **Segmentation Masks:** Binary masks highlighting the detected corrosion areas.
- **Overlay Images:** Original images overlaid with colored masks to visually indicate corrosion.
- **Annotations:** A text file summarizing the corrosion severity for each processed image.

The solution is built with a deep learning segmentation model (U-Net with a pretrained ResNet34 backbone from the `segmentation_models` library) combined with traditional color thresholding and advanced post‑processing (including CRF refinement) to maximize accuracy and robustness. This system is optimized for CPU‑only environments, making it accessible for development on standard laptops.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Clone this project to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-hesham07/corrosion-annotation.git
   cd corrosion-annotation
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
    **Note:** If you encounter issues with `segmentation_models`, install it via:
   > ```bash
   > pip install git+https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models
   > ```

## Data Preparation

### For Training:
- **Training Images:**  
  Place your training images in the folder `train_images/Corrosion/`.  
  Ensure images are well-captured and representative of various corrosion scenarios.

- **Ground Truth Masks:**  
  Create corresponding binary masks for each training image and store them in `train_masks/Corrosion/`.  
  The masks should have corrosion areas in white (255) and background in black (0).

### For Inference:
- **Input Images:**  
  Place the images you want to analyze in the `input_images/` folder.

---

## Training the Model

To train the segmentation model, run the `train_model.py` script. This script:

1. **Builds the Model:**  
   Uses a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet34 encoder and a combined loss function (BCE + Dice Loss).

2. **Data Augmentation:**  
   Applies image augmentations like flipping, rotation, and rescaling to improve model robustness.

3. **Training Process:**  
   Trains the model on your dataset and saves the trained model as `model.h5`.

Run the training script with:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
*Note: Training on a CPU-only laptop may take longer; adjust epochs and batch sizes as needed.*

---

## Inference and Annotation

After training, run the `main.py` script to process images in the `input_images/` folder. The script:

1. **Loads the Trained Model:**  
   Loads `model.h5` (if available) for deep learning predictions.

2. **Generates Segmentation Masks:**  
   Predicts corrosion regions using the deep learning model and refines predictions with traditional color thresholding and optional CRF post‑processing.

3. **Classification:**  
   Classifies corrosion severity (HIGH, Severe, Medium, Low, or None) based on the area ratio of the corrosion mask.

4. **Output Generation:**  
   Saves the raw image, the binary segmentation mask, and an overlay image (original image with corrosion highlighted) into `output_images/` and appends detailed annotations to `output_images/annotations.txt`.

Run inference with:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Detailed Workflow

1. **Preprocessing:**  
   - **Data Augmentation:** Random flips, rotations, and scaling during training.
   - **Contrast Enhancement:** CLAHE and bilateral filtering applied in both training and inference.

2. **Deep Learning Segmentation:**  
   - **Architecture:** U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder pretrained on ImageNet.
   - **Loss Functions:** Combined Binary Crossentropy and Dice Loss to manage class imbalance.
   - **Inference:** Resizes images to the model’s input size (256×256), predicts a mask, and resizes back to original dimensions.

3. **Traditional Processing and Ensemble:**  
   - **Color Thresholding:** Uses HSV thresholding to create a secondary mask for rust detection.
   - **Ensemble Fusion:** Combines the deep learning prediction and the traditional mask using a bitwise OR.
   - **Post-Processing:** Applies morphological operations and, if available, CRF for refined mask boundaries.

4. **Classification and Overlay:**  
   - **Classification:** Computes the ratio of corrosion area to total image area to classify severity.
   - **Overlay Generation:** Blends the original image with a red mask highlighting corrosion areas.

5. **Output:**  
   - **Raw Image:** Saved copy of the input image.
   - **Segmentation Mask:** Binary mask indicating corrosion regions.
   - **Overlay:** Combined image with corrosion highlighted.
   - **Annotations:** A text file summarizing the results.

## Improvements and Optimizations

The project includes several strategies to improve accuracy and performance:

- **Model Architecture:**  
  Utilizes a robust U-Net with a pretrained encoder to extract high-level features.

- **Loss Functions:**  
  Combines BCE with Dice Loss to focus on both pixel-level accuracy and overall mask quality.

- **Data Augmentation:**  
  Extensive use of data augmentation improves generalization.

- **Ensemble Methods:**  
  Fuses deep learning predictions with traditional color-based masks for improved robustness.

- **Post-Processing:**  
  Applies morphological operations and CRF post‑processing to refine segmentation boundaries.

- **CPU-Only Optimization:**  
  The project is designed to run on CPU-only machines by setting TensorFlow to use CPU and tuning batch sizes and epochs.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No Images Found:**  
  Ensure your training data is correctly organized under the subfolders (e.g., `train_images/Corrosion/` and `train_masks/Corrosion/`).

- **Segmentation Models Compatibility Issues:**  
  If you encounter errors with `segmentation_models`, try installing the latest version directly from GitHub:
  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models
  ```

- **CRF Not Available:**  
  If `pydensecrf` is not installed, the system will skip CRF post‑processing. Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install pydensecrf
  ```

- **Training Speed:**  
  Running on a CPU will be slower than using a GPU. Consider reducing the model size or epochs for faster iterations during development.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Architectures:**  
  Explore Transformer-based segmentation models for even higher accuracy.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  
  Use automated tools to fine-tune learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters.

- **Ensemble Learning:**  
  Combine multiple segmentation models to further reduce false positives and negatives.

- **Edge Deployment:**  
  Optimize and convert models to ONNX or TensorRT for faster inference on edge devices.
